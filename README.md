# Course Description

In this course students will learn the fundamentals of computation, software design, and web technologies, through a series of creative projects. The course is intended to equip students with the skills to develop artistic and business projects that include a significant computational component. Topics such as variables, functions, components, and functional and reactive programming will be brought together to create interactive applications, generative art, data visualization, and other domains. Within the framework of these creative projects students will develop a greater understanding of how computer programs operate, be exposed to various concepts used to create experiences and interactions, and become more familiar with some of the technologies that constitute the internet. This course is intended for students with no prior programming background.

## Course Overview and Learning Outcomes

Students will learn computational thinking, program design, and debugging, within a creative context. They will learn elementary theory of color, sound, animation, sound, and text, in the course of writing programs that use these elements. Over the course of a series of individual and group projects, they will develop project development and project management skills and presentation skills. They will reflect on their workflows as an example of a process, on similarities between the process of developing a program and improving a workflow, and on other wider applications of computational thinking and systems thinking. They will learn some tools of coding, web development, and collaborative programming.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- practice and produce the fundamentals of programming, focusing on:
  - variables, values, types, and expressions,
  - variable mutation,
  - functions that use side effects, and
  - pure functions that return values;
- demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming and integrate the concept into practical applications;
  - discuss the concept of modularity and reusability;
  - develop and utilize arrays, objects, and predefined classes;
  - design and implement classes;
- apply comprehensively various methods in p5.js and visualize generative and interactive animations;
- combine fundamentals of web development with visual programming techniques to produce creative web pages, exploring;
  - basic uses of HTML DOM and CSS;
  - the relationship between JavaScript (JS), p5.js, a web page, and a browser;
- demonstrate and practice troubleshooting skills and debugging strategies, including:
  - ability to use online p5.js and JavaScript reference materials,
  - uses of the developer console for debugging;
- expand and apply knowledge and experience in other programming languages;
  - find, evaluate, and use third-party libraries through copied files, package.json and a CDN.
  - add libraries by copying files, using package.json, or using a CDN.
  - employ a web API to request and pull useful data in JSON format.
  - demonstrate the differences between JavaScript and another programming language.
- utilize and practice the command lines
  - make a use of the command line to navigate the file hierarchy directories, create and move files and directories.
  - demonstrate the ability to create (from a template), modify, and run a program that uses npm.
- produce an interactive web project by utilizing a combination of concepts and techniques discussed and demonstrated throughout the course, and;
- develop and discuss meaningful and effective user interactions and visualizations, and recognize the context of Creative Coding.
