### Faculty

* Moon: ([By appointment](jh.moon@nyu.edu))
* Steele: By appointment. [Sign up here.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UU1TaDFWeEV2ZzFHfGRlZmF1bHR8NzBkMmRmNGEzZGE3ZDBmNzExMGUwYWZkYzkwZmFkYWI)

To ensure that the instructor is available, schedule your appointment at least
an hour ahead of time. Google Calendar will let you schedule it at the last
minute, but the instructor may not see it or be available then.

Please note that both sections follow the same syllabus, so even if you
cannot meet with your own instructor, feel free to sign up with another. If none
of the times work for your schedule, please email your instructor for an
appointment.
