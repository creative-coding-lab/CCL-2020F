## Lesson Notes

### Day 1.1 – Sept. 14

- Introductions
- Slides
- Activity 1.1: Blind Drawing
- After-class Q&A:
  - Will the course be hybrid → no, for now
  - Are we using NYU Classes → no; we will use Google Classroom
  - Can we see you in person for office-hour appointments → yes and I’m looking forward to that, also you can find the Fellows in the studio

### Day 1.2 – Sept. 16

- Demo of editor.p5.js
  - Use Chrome for web development. There’s lots of browsers and your code will run in all of them, but Chrome works best for writing.
  - The Run button. Auto-refresh.
  - Exploring the behavior of `rect` by changing the numbers
  - Also use the [p5 reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)
  - Errors
    - Code is very picky, sensitive to punctuation
    - Where are errors displayed? (Several places.)
  - Becoming fluent involves learning (going forward) what errors produce what error messages, so that you can go backwards from error messages to errors.
- [Activity 1.2: Shape Discovery](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tk9ynir82-2H7cX-dJCPBLnyV6xrW3AKzxFFfxBcSDs/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Note on `“ ”` and `‘ ’` vs. `" "` and `' '`. Code that is copied from web will often use the curly quotes, because publishing platforms format for English (or Western languages). This is wrong for programs; you will need to correct pasted code.
- Notes on copying code:
  - Good to copy examples, other people’s code
  - Three-line examples from references, things you co-write with a Fellow / LA / Instructor, don’t need to be acknowledged. Everything else does.
  - This is for academic integrity, same as anything you create in any course.
  - You should also take time to understand all the code you include, in order to meet the learning objectives.
  - This may mean sitting with an instructor to go over lines of code.

### Day 1.R – Sept. 17

- Introductions
  – newly-joined students
  - Kenneth (Learning Assistant)
- Livecoding – review of `frame`, `fill`, RGB color. (The 2.2 slides will cover this.)
- [Activity 1.R: Drawing With Code](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8NPcCBiqCgyaAi0itfPrnP4NqtHRAlSj6JDfTC07nw/edit?usp=sharing)
