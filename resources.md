[CCLab
Cookbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y2A9jh5XxCojrMkIbzu2FROSv4Tl3izR-OERsgMzCZc/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=112951101116018294463).
A coding cookbook contains recipes, organized by task.

[p5.js
examples](https://www.notion.so/p5-js-Examples-18214cd693bd43919d9d0c4cded0b05f)
demonstrate how to do things that have come up during student projects:
controlling gif animation, cross-fading audio, slicing sketches, etc.

[p5.js step-by-step
tutorials](https://www.notion.so/55581dbef83f40e3a386ddc6be1bbee8?v=6cbd3221f9ca493781875887b169abca)
demonstrate various concepts or techniques. These differ from the _examples_ in
that they take several steps to build up to a complete solution, and may general
some alternative solutions along the way. They are intended to teach an
understanding of various concepts along the way to the solution, rather than to
present it wholesale.
